## Studies on cloud native impact on enterprise architecture and solution design


So, maybe the most radical idea coming from microservices and cloud native it’s not technical at all. But organizational.

James Lewis and Martin Fowler coined a really interesting concept which they called The 'Inverse Conway Maneuver'. And this theory  “recommends evolving your team and organizational structure to promote your desired architecture. Ideally your technology architecture will display isomorphism with your business architecture.”. This is bold and is going a bit further then adding Dev + Ops as implies the possibility of radical changes within Enterprise and Organizational Architecture as a whole, the criteria being “if affects the product and its added value, then organizationa change should be considered).
 
Distributed Architectures such as, EDA, SOA under principles of DDD created the conditions to forge Microservices. This architectural baseline has a lot of value, 

but it’s the Cloud Native operational predicated which allows to release Microservices full potential to the organization.
